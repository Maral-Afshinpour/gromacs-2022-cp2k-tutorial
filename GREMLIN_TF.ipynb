        "### Change log:\n",
        "*   02Apr2019\n",
        " - fixing a few hard-coded values, to allow GREMLIN to work with any alphabet (binary, protein, rna etc)\n",
        "*   22Jan2019\n",
        " - moving [GREMLIN_TF_simple](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/GREMLIN_CPP/blob/master/GREMLIN_TF_simple.ipynb) to a seperate notebook\n",
        "*   19Jan2019\n",
        " - in the past we found that optimizing V first, required less iterations for convergence. Since V can be computed exactly (assuming no W), we replace this first optimization step with a simple V initialization.\n",
        " - a few variables were renamed to be consistent with the c++ version\n",
        "*   16Jan2019\n",
        " - updating how indices are handled (for easier/cleaner parsing)\n",
        " - minor speed up in how we symmetrize and zero the diagional of W\n",
        "*   15Jan2019\n",
        " - LBFGS optimizer replaced with a modified version of the ADAM optimizer\n",
        " - Added option for stochastic gradient descent (via batch_size)\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Method:\n",
        "GREMLIN takes a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and returns a Markov Random Field (MRF). The MRF consists of a one-body term (V) that encodes conservation, and a two-body term (W) that encodes co-evolution.\n",

        "See [GREMLIN_TF_simple](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/GREMLIN_CPP/blob/master/GREMLIN_TF_simple.ipynb) for a stripped down version of this code (with no funky gap removal, sequence weight, etc). This is intented for educational purpose,  and could also be very useful for anyone trying to modify or improve the algorithm!\n"

Further correction (average product correction) is then performed to the mtx[\"raw\"] to remove the effects of entropy, mtx[\"apc\"]. The relative ranking of mtx[\"apc\"] is used to assess importance. When there are enough effective sequences (>1000), we find that the top 1.0L contacts are ~90% accurate! When the number of effective sequences is lower, NN can help clean noise and fill in missing contacts.\n"
